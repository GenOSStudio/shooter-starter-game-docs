## Playing the Game

Testing your game within the **Unreal Engine Editor** is an essential step in development. It allows you to quickly iterate on gameplay mechanics, test multiplayer functionality,
and make adjustments in real time. In this section, we’ll guide you through the process of running your game directly in the editor, whether you're testing it in **single-player** or **multiplayer mode**.
This approach gives you the flexibility to evaluate the game without needing to build or package it for deployment.

Once in **Play In Editor** (*PIE*) mode, your **Player Controller** will take possession of the **Shooter Pawn**.
The level contains several portals that load into different **Experiences**, allowing you to explore and test various game mechanics.
