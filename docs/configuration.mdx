## Configuring Game Data

In this section, you'll learn how to customize and configure the core game elements that control gameplay mechanics, player behaviors, and other essential features.
By adjusting these settings, you can tailor the game to fit your desired experience, whether it's changing the rules of the game, modifying player attributes, or configuring weapons and HUD elements.
This process allows you to fine-tune the game to meet your specific needs, whether for single-player or multiplayer modes. Let's dive into the key areas where you can make adjustments and enhance your project.

The `ShooterGameData` asset allows users to assign specific game **Experiences** to each **Map** in the project.
This system provides flexibility to customize gameplay by associating unique experiences with different maps.

The `ShooterGameData` asset is located at: `/ShooterStarterGame/ShooterGameData`

![ShooterGameDataImage](/assets/ShooterGame_Data.png)

The **ShooterGameData** asset uses a **TMap** to associate maps with their respective game experiences. Below is an overview of the structure:

<AccordionGroup>

### Phase Definition

The **ShooterGamePhase** class is responsible for defining the behavior and logic of a **Specific Phase** in the game.
Each phase corresponds to a particular stage of the game, such as the **Warmup**, **Active Gameplay**, or **Post-Game**.
This class handles the transitions, events, and actions that occur during that **Phase**.

![ShooterGamePhasesImage](/assets/ShooterGame_Phases.png)

Key responsibilities of the **ShooterGamePhase** class include:
- **Managing Game State Transitions:** It ensures the game moves from one **Phase** to another, such as from **Warmup** to **Active Gameplay**, and finally to **Post-Game**.
- **Handling Phase-Specific Logic:** Each phase may have unique logic, such as countdown timers during **Warmup**,tracking gameplay objectives during the **Playing** phase, or displaying match results in the **Post-Game** phase.
- **Customizable Behavior:** Developers can extend or modify this class to introduce custom behaviors or new phases to fit the needs of the game.

By using the **ShooterGamePhase** class, the game can be organized into well-defined segments,
each with its own **Rules** and **Flow**, providing a more structured and customizable **Game Experience**.

![ShooterGamePhaseImage](/assets/ShooterGame_Phase.png)

The table provides a detailed overview of the variables that define each **ShooterGamePhase**. These variables control the behavior, **Duration**, and **Communication** of the phase within the game.
By configuring these **Variables**, you can customize how each **Phase** operates, what **Gameplay Effects** are applied, and how **Messages** are **Broadcast** to other systems during that **Phase**.

<Accordion title="Game Phase Definition">
  <Property name="Name" type="Name" optional>
    The identifier for the **Phase**, used to label and reference it in the game logic.

  <Property name="Duration" type="Float" required>
    Specifies the **Length** of the **Phase** in **Seconds**.

    <Info>
      If the **Duration** of a **Phase** is set to **-1**, the **Phase** will never automatically **End**.
      It will remain active indefinitely unless manually **Deactivated** or the **Current State** is changed by the **Game Mode**.
      This is useful in scenarios where you want a **Phase**, such as the **Playing Phase**, to remain **Active** without a **Time Limit**.
      For example, if you set the **Playing Phase** to have no end time (*by setting the duration to -1*), it will continue until the **Game Mode** explicitly changes the **State** or manually **Deactivates** it.
    </Info>
  </Property>
  ---
  <Property name="Phase Tags" type="GameplayTagContainer" optional>
    Similar to **Experience Tags**, these **Tags** control gameplay behavior but are only **Active** during the respective **Phase**.
