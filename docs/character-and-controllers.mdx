title: Character and Controllers
description: Explore the gameplay mechanics and player experience in the development build of the Shooter Starter Game.
---

**Characters** and **Controllers** are the heart of **Player** and **AI** interactions in the **Shooter Starter Game**.
This section focuses on the systems that manage **movement**, **Input**, and behavior for both **Player-Controlled Characters** and **Bots**.
You’ll learn how to configure **Character** classes, customize **Controllers**, and implement **AI** behaviors that create responsive and challenging gameplay.
By mastering these systems, you can deliver smooth and engaging interactions that elevate the player experience.

## Character Configuration

The **Character Configuration** section delves into the customizable aspects of the **In-Game Character**.
This includes defining **Settings** for **Audio**, **Inventory**, **Health**, and **Movement**, ensuring your character behaves and responds as intended in various gameplay scenarios.
By tailoring these **Configurations**, you can create a more immersive and engaging player experience.

### Character Movement

The **Movement Settings** define how your **Character** navigates the game world, covering aspects like **Walk Speed**, **Sprint Speed**, and special movement abilities (*e.g., crouching, dashing, aiming*).
These **Settings** ensure that your **Character's Movement** feels intuitive and responsive to **Player Inputs**.
